1. Higher Order Functions :
Functions that take other functions as arguments or return them.

2. Constructor Functions :
Old-school way of creating objects before ES6 classes.

3. First-Class Functions :
Functions treated as values → assigned, returned, passed around.

4. new Keyword :
Creates object instances, controls this, links prototypes.

5. IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) :
Executes instantly + creates private scope.

6. Prototype :
The hidden parent object that stores shared methods.

7. Prototypical Inheritance :
Objects inheriting from other objects via prototype chain.

8. this / call / apply / bind :
Function execution context control (very advanced & tricky).

9. Pure & Impure Functions :
Functional programming concepts, used for optimization & clean code.

10. Closures :
Functions remembering variables even after parent execution ends.
(One of the most advanced topics!)
